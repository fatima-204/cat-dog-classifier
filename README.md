# Cat vs. Dog Classifier

A deep learning model trained to classify images of cats and dogs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Includes training, evaluation, and inference scripts.

## Features

- **CNN-based Model**: Built with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
- **Training Script**: Train the model on a dataset of cat and dog images.
- **Inference**: Predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fatima-204/cat-dog-classifier.git
   cd cat-dog-classifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Run inference:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```
